# Go-Green
Go Green App for MODS
 -Thus far we have been able to implement a world map and a recycling activity screen
both which make the app far more interactive and informative than the previous
rendition. We have also made the application more developer friendly by adding the
ability to manipulate and change activity screens and the java code that goes along with
it. We have also added an initial analytics page, the fate of which will be determined by
the project design team.

- Sergio Ramirez - Java and XML code - Made buttons and optimized layout of main
activity screen, created analytics screen.

- Catherine Swerdloff - UI - Generated layout of home screen and information screen,
adapted map and trash can for implementation in app, XML files for map buttons and for
trash can button.

- Most of the application changes have been done colabortivalaey between the two of
us, and any changes made from the app last year have been mad in collaboration
between Catherine and Sergio.

- To be done: Optimize games, finalize layout, redesign “Recycling at Mods” and
“Climate Change” activity screens including new graphics and new layout of information.
Improve existing games e.g. add hints to hangman, place the quiz in a better location
within the app, improve on the questions in the quiz, etc. If time permitting, create a new
game that incorporates new ideas and information from the past games and the
information already available through the app.

- The work to be done will be done collaboratively between all 4 parts of the app team.
